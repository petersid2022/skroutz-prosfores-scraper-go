# Possible Optimizations

* Use goroutines (Concurrency)

* Use a database (GORM)

* Use a caching mechanism

* Use a better URL shortener service (Bitly or Google URL Shortener)

* Use a better HTML parsing library (GoQuery)

Input is very much accepted. This is a ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) program, so as you would expect there are a few* rough edges.
